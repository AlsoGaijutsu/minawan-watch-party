# Minawan Watch Party

Chill with all the minawan while you watch cerber's streams! Watch everyone walk around with snippits of conversation.
Want to personalise yourself? Draw a custom minawan and submit it so everyone can see you walk around!
Want to chill in the discord? Choose a channel and see minawan chatting on your taskbar!

Cerber isn't streaming? Worry not, desktop Cerby will playfully run around your screen and mess with everything on it!

## Roadmap:

- Get minawan walking around above taskbar
- Create 7tv style message bubbles with emotes inline with text
- React to common leaving messages, eg
    - Goodnight variants sends minawan to sleep, icon fades
    - Goodbye variants makes a door appear which minawan leave through
- Upload custom minawan to be synced across all users (maybe?)
