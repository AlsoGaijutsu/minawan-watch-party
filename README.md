# Minawan Watch Party

Chill with all the minawan while you watch cerber's streams! Watch everyone walk around with snippits of conversation.
Want to personalise yourself? Draw a custom minawan and submit it so everyone can see you walk around!
Want to chill in the discord? Choose a channel and see minawan chatting on your taskbar!

Cerber isn't streaming? Worry not, desktop Cerby will playfully run around your screen and mess with everything on it!

## Roadmap:

- Get minawan walking around above taskbar
- React to common leaving messages, eg
    - Goodnight variants sends minawan to sleep, icon fades
    - Goodbye variants makes door appear which minawan leave through


## Rough plans

### Initial build

When someone sends a message, they join the watch group, and a timestamp of their last message is saved
People who don't send a message for at least 20 mins will fade, assuming they have left. - Possible config to disable this and let minawan build up forever xdx
Minawan will walk across the screen randomly and have a chance to display messages that are sent - Config to set chance
Highlighted messages and messages with bits will have a special highlighted box and will always show.
Scan messages for common leaving variants and have their sprite react to it.
